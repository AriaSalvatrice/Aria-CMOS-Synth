4040 Breakout Board
-------------------

[Based on the Logic Noise series](https://hackaday.com/2015/02/17/logic-noise-8-bits-of-glorious-sounds/). Layout meant for a 40Ã—60 mm perfboard. No schematic was made for that one, but it's really simple. It drives LEDs directly, which might be a terrible idea, I have not really checked (it works tho). I routed the cables above the chip, which was a terrible idea. Also, the angled headers do not have sufficient lateral clearance as indicated, I had to bend them to be vertical instead.
