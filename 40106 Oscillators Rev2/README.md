40106 Oscillators Rev2
----------------------

This build is meant to use my Perma-Proto PCBs Rev1. 

The oscillators are [based on the Logic Noise series](https://hackaday.com/2015/03/09/logic-noise-sawing-away-with-analog-waveforms/). The [schematics from Castle Rocktronics were also used](http://castlerocktronics.com/modular/articles/CR-001_-_4xSQUARE.pdf). It's worth noting that when using all inverters on a 40106, they will have a fairly noticeable amount of cross-talk.

To fill the space, there are also passive mults, LDRs, pushbuttons, and a pair of vactrol LPG, I cribbed [the schematics from Mystic Circuits](https://github.com/mysticcircuits/0HP_Modular/tree/master/Hardware/0HP%20Vactrol%20LPG-VCA). The vactrols are handmade with a LDR and a LED in heat shrink tubing. They need decent current to work, not everything in my system manages to ping them properly, so I wanna remake that part better later.

I made a Rev 1 of it previously, but it's too flawed to bother documenting.
