4017 Breakout Board
-------------------

[Based on the Logic Noise series](https://hackaday.com/2015/04/24/logic-noise-sequencing-in-silicon/). The article suggests using two 4017 to drive LEDs, but this design uses transistors instead. Seems to work fine. Layout built for a breadboard-style PCB. Limited to 8 steps.

Some resistors are mislabeled, cross-reference with schematic.
