4017 Breakout Board Rev1
------------------------

8-step counter.

[Based on the Logic Noise series](https://hackaday.com/2015/04/24/logic-noise-sequencing-in-silicon/). The article suggests using two 4017 to drive LEDs, but this design uses transistors instead. Seems to work fine. Layout built for a breadboard-style PCB. Harwired reset to limit it to 8 steps, which is more useful in conventional music than the chip's maximum of 10.

This revised layout was not double-checked against the working original build (as I altered the layout a bit on the fly while building).
