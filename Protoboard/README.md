Protoboard Rev2 WIP
-------------------

Inspired by commercialy available Pemanent Prototype boards, and [Analog Output's Protoboard for Eurorack and Kosmo](https://github.com/holmesrichards/Protoboard).

These are the WIP files for Rev2, still a lot of work to do to improve.

This is a picture of Rev1. It has a few flaws (such as the status LED shorting if connecting). It was my first PCB ever, so I'm happy it even worked at all.
