Protoboard Rev2 WIP
-------------------

Inspired by commercialy available Pemanent Prototype boards, and [Analog Output's Protoboard for Eurorack and Kosmo](https://github.com/holmesrichards/Protoboard). It's 99Ã—99 mm, to get the best deal from PCB fab houses.

There's built-in reverse voltage protection, a status LED, a main decoupling capacitor, room for 6 potentiometers or tactile buttons, and two half-breadboard layouts stacked over each other, with power rails.

These are the WIP files for Rev2, still a lot of work to do to finish it.

This is a picture of Rev1. It has a few flaws (such as the status LED shorting if connecting). It was my first PCB ever, so I'm happy it even worked at all.
