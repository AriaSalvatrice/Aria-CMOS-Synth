Output Module Rev1
------------------

Based on the [Castle Rocktronics schematics](http://castlerocktronics.com/modular/articles/CR-002_-_Output_Mixer.pdf). Like it's basically a copy-paste at this point. Using a TL072 that is almost certainly not authentic. You'll need to amplify the signal to listen to it comfortably (the original schematics suggest a way to do it, but I haven't bothered).

Built for a 60Ã—40 mm perfboard, drilled to fit a mini-jack, with grooves for the potentiometer routed out using a rotary tool with a cutoff wheel. Wear a respirator while machining a PCB!

I made the mixer separately. Its design has a fatal flaw so I will not bother to document it.
